# EM Algorithm and Naive Bayes with EM
## <u> Introduction </u>
This exercise focuses on the implementation of two key machine learning algorithms: the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the Naive Bayes algorithm that utilizes EM for calculating likelihoods. Additionally, you will learn how to visualize your results, which is crucial for gaining insights and assessing the performance of your algorithms.

## <u> Purpose </u>
The primary purpose of this exercise is to provide hands-on experience with the EM algorithm and its application in the context of Naive Bayes. By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

Understand the fundamental principles of the EM algorithm.
Implement the EM algorithm for a specific problem or dataset.
Implement a Naive Bayes classifier that uses EM for calculating likelihoods.
Create visualizations to interpret and evaluate the results of your algorithms.
